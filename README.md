# 5DOF-Robotic-Arm
# 5-DOF Robotic Arm

This project contains the 3D design of a **5 Degree of Freedom (5-DOF) Robotic Arm**, modeled using Tinkercad. The robotic arm consists of several rotational joints allowing flexible movement and a gripper for picking objects.

## ðŸ›  Features

- 5 Degrees of Freedom:
  - Base rotation (Yaw)
  - Shoulder movement (Pitch)
  - Elbow movement (Pitch)
  - Wrist movement (Pitch or Roll)
  - Gripper open/close
- Designed in Tinkercad
- Modular design for easy modification
- Can be exported for 3D printing or simulation
